                    <Paragraph>
                        We have worked on several long-term projects for companies such as Build A World Aps., Imverse S.A., S Ditt B.V., and Applications In CADD.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Also we have conducted Graphics Performance Appraisals and outsourced R&amp;D for RELEX Solutions and Synera GmbH. Most of our work is in the CAD space, with occasional game development in between.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You may find our GitHub profiles within the Khronos adjacent ecosystem, with contributions to Validation Layers, SPIR-V Cross, and over 100 bug reports and test cases for the DirectX Shader Compiler.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We are 8 time Vulkanised and 2 time Shading Language Symposium conference speakers in the 2023, 2024 and 2026 years.
                        <br />
                        For the 2026 edition we were the Platinum Sponsors.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Collectively we’re experienced in Vulkan, SPIR-V, OpenGL (ES and WebGL included), DirectX12 and 11, CUDA, OpenCL, WebGPU, and NVN for GPU APIs as well as CMake, Docker, Jenkins, Python, SWIG, .Net7 and WASM, Emscripten, Typescript, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Proxmox and Language Engineering.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Finally, many of us have Mathematics Degrees.

                        from heavy 50%+ discounts on co-development and maintenance of Vulkan Utilities used in
                        your project similar to those present in the CUDA space such as CUB.
                        Finally our Consultants constantly benefit from each other’s experience and insights delivering
                        solutions a step above those devisable in solitude, even if a project has a singular Consultant.
